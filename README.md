# Waybridge Technical Assessment - Kevin Sun

This repository contains Kevin Sun's Waybridge Technical Assessment. 

It is split into two parts: 
1. Calculating the Rolling Average using Pandas
2. Calculating the Rolling Average using Python 

Both parts have a jupyter notebook file and a python file. For better viewing experience, I recommend viewing the jupyter notebook files as they are annotated with my comments and show output. 

Thank you for the opportunity to take this challenge!
