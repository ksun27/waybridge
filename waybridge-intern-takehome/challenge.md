# Challenge

In this challenge, we will be looking at calculating a rolling average of a time series where events occur at non-uniform time intervals.

Included with this challenge are:
* **example.csv**, containing a sample set of data, with time column provided in seconds.
* **example.png**, an example output of some rolling average data over time, plotted on top of the original un-averaged data.
* boiler plate code written in python, however, you are not under any obligation to use python or the boiler plate code.

Our ask is for you to write a function (or complete the boilerplate code) to calculate a rolling average. 

# Some notes:

* You can use any other external libraries that you like.
* You will be assessed on the correctness, performance, scalability, readability, and maintainability of your submission. Although it is definitely important to have functional code, we are also very interested in the performance of your solution, why you chose whatever approach you did, and having the code be easy to run and understand.
* You should consider thinking about potential edge cases, what the implications of non-uniform time intervals could be on running your code or finding a rolling average at any given point in time, and how your algorithm performs with different parameters or datasets.

Please submit your code, and include 
* Comments about how you came up with your solution
* Comments on any additional assumptions you made
* How to run your solution (e.g. if there are any external dependencies), a readme might be a good idea.
* Any images/outputs that shows the actual output from your solution.
* And anything else we might find useful in assessing your submission.

Good luck!
